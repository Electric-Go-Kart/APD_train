# Autonomous Pedestrian Detection (APD) Training

This is a modified version of the Kitti dataset's included Jupyter notebook to meet our usecase.

Changes to the original are mainly developed by [Andrew Helmreich](https://github.com/achelm15 "Andrew Helmreich"), with help from [Ryan Guidice](https://github.com/rguidice "Ryan Guidice").

Before downloading and running this notebook, make sure to add in the Kitti dataset image link and labels link. Those links can be found by registering for an account on the Kitti site (linked [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/user_login.php)). This has to be done to comply with the download policy specified by the Kitti team.

Word of advice, you'll probably want to do this in Colab.
