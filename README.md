Before downloading and running this notebook, make sure to add in the Kitti dataset image link and labels link. Those links can be found by registering for an account on the Kitti site (linked [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/user_login.php)). This has to be done to comply with the download policy specified by the Kitti team. You'll also need to add your Roboflow API key if you want to add any custom data.

Word of advice, you'll probably want to do this in Colab.
